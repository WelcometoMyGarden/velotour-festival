The website for the WTMG Tour Festival.

Deployed using GitHub Pages from the root of the main branch.

For the first development setup, run `npm install`, and create a file called `.env` next to this README.file, with the contents:

```bash
NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

To preview your changes, run `npm start` in a Terminal to start the Astro live server. In VSCode, you can also go to Terminal -> Run Build Task in the top menu for the same effect.

This will start a preview server that you can access at [http://localhost:4321/](http://localhost:4321/).

Opening this repository in CodeSandbox automates the above (see
`.codesandbox/tasks.json`). From there, Pull Requests can be sent for merging
with the main branch as well.
