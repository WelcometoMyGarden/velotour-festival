            Please read this carefully before coming to the Velotour Festival

            <h3>safe and welcoming cycling festival for all</h3>
            <p>
              The following code outlines the requirements for participants’
              conduct on and off the road during the Velotour Festival from 1 to
              3 May, from 14 to 17 May and from 23 to 25 May 2026, and is
              designed to offer a safe and welcoming cycling festival for all
              regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation,
              socioeconomic status, physical appearance, ability and religion
              (or lack thereof). <br /><br />Organizers do not tolerate
              harassment of participants in any form including offensive
              language, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
              stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
              disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
              contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to
              stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
              <br /><br />All participants, organizers and volunteers at the
              Velotour Festival are required to agree with the present code of
              conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
              We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure
              a safe and welcoming environment for everybody. <br /><br />Any
              conduct that breaches this code could result in actions organizers
              deem appropriate, including warning or your removal from the
              Velotour Festival and organizers will not be liable to refund the
              cost of the festival or any expenses this removal incurs.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h4>1. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS</h4>
            <p>
              All participants are required to observe the law wherever we go,
              both on and off the bike. Failure to do so will result in removal
              from the festival. <br /><br />Participants must follow all
              traffic rules and road rules of the
              <a rel="license" href="https://wegcode.be/"
                >Belgian Traffic Code</a
              >. This means you have the same responsibilities as road users and
              must obey all traffic signals such as red lights, stop signs, etc.
              just as you would driving a bike on your own. <br /><br />Police
              escorting may be applicable for some parts of the tour.
              Instructions of the Police must be followed. <br /><br />There's a
              liability and physical damage insurance for all volunteers and a
              basic physical damage insurance for all participants. Yet, with
              your registration you agree and confirm that you participate at
              your own risk and responsibility. You will be asked to sign a
              disclaimer on the first day to waive any liability claim towards
              the organisers.
            </p>

            <h4>2. GENERAL CONDUCT</h4>
            <p>
              Please behave on the festival as you would be at home, on holiday
              or on a bike trip: with respect and consideration for the other
              participants, volunteers and organizers as well as others around
              you. Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you
              contribute to the community and the positive image of cycling and
              bike touring. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech
              and actions. Please avoid making assumptions. Attempt
              collaboration before conflict.

              <br /><br />More specifically you must:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Read, understand and conform with the cycling safety
                instructions and the Belgian Traffic Code.
              </li>
              <li>
                Report any accidents, injuries, loss or damage suffered during
                the festival before leaving the festival.
              </li>
              <li>
                Represent cycling and bike touring in a positive light.
                Organizers require you to refrain from using bad language and
                any anti-social behavior during the festival.
              </li>
              <li>
                Behave with respect to other participants, volunteers and
                organizers at all times. Oppressive behavior (i.e. patriarchal,
                racist, sexist, etc.) discriminatory, demeaning and harassing
                language or anti-social conduct will not be tolerated in any
                form.
              </li>
              <li>
                Respect the volunteers and organizers property and that of other
                participants. You are responsible for damage or loss you incur
                and are liable for replacement and repair costs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contact the organisers immediately if you are being harassed,
                notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
                concerns.
              </li>
              <li>Not litter at any time.</li>
              <li>Keep noise to a minimum between 10pm and 7am.</li>
              <li>
                Keep alcohol consumption to a reasonable level. Drunkenness or
                under-age drinking is not tolerated and may be referred to the
                police.
              </li>
              <li>Don't smoke within 25 meters of the meal and rest places.</li>
              <li>
                Don't use drugs at the festival. Presence of drugs may be
                referred to the police.
              </li>
              <li>
                Respect landowners and public space at any time. The organizers
                have planned comfort stops along the route so please check with
                them – it could well be the case that a comfortable toilet block
                is just minutes away.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be aware that the organisers may ask you to help and act at a
                specific time in order to keep the festival running on schedule.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. CANCELLATION POLICY</h4>
            <p>
              Please note that the Velotour Festival is a community event, so
              your registration cannot be resold to someone else. You can cancel
              and get a full refund up to one month before the festival. It's
              not possible to cancel and get refunded in the month before the
              event. You can only change weekends if there is availability left.

              <br /><br />Last but not least, if you agree with the code of
              conduct above, we are very much looking forward to welcoming you
              at the Velotour Festival. Please smile, relax and enjoy yourself!
            </p>
