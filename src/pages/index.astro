          <h3>Why this Festival</h3>
          <p>
            Exploring by bicycle makes you feel alive. It's a unique way to
            discover a region. What if you combine this with meeting other
            enthusiasts and have a great time together?<br /><br />The Velotour
            Festival gives you the opportunity to travel by bicycle in Belgium
            and meet new people.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="icon fa-paper-plane">
          <h3>For whom?</h3>
          <p>
            For both curious-minded people who want to discover bicycle touring
            and experienced bicycle travellers to share their passion and
            stories.<br /><br />From solo travelers to families, everyone is
            welcome. If you are travelling with your 5 best friends, we doubt
            you’ll still have time to meet others, so no groups please!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="icon fa-paper-plane">
          <h3>Equipment</h3>

            panniers with camping gear (tent, sleeping bag & mattress) and
            repair kit.<br /><br />Yet, not owning equipment shouldn't stop you
            from participating, ask a friend to lend you equipment or leave a
            comment in the registration form so that we can help you.

            itinerary before the event and on the first day during the briefing.

            touring. Please let us know about your suggestions in the
            registration form! Those activities won't be next to the tents, so
            that you can also rest if you want to.

            evening.<br /><br />Your registration cannot be resold to someone
